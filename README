#EXAMPLE: 

# api wrapper w/ your aws credentials
aws = Best3(aws_key, aws_secret_key)

# make a call to s3, args are: http method, REST uri (w/ params), request headers, request body

# get a list of buckets
puts aws.s3('GET', '/', {}, '').inspect 

# put a custom acl on an object
puts aws.s3('PUT', '/path/to/object?acl', {'Content-Type' => 'text/xml'}, acl_in_xml)

# NOTES:
# all output is in the raw rest api output
# wraps signing of requests for you, which is a pain
# currently works with s3 and cloudfront
# very alpha so not all stuff is tested but the library is small
